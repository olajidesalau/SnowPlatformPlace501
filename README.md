## 📝 Development Notes

### Database Management
- Local development uses SQLite in `.wrangler/state/v3/d1/`
- Production uses Cloudflare D1 globally distributed database
- Migrations are applied separately for local and production
- Use `--local` flag for all local database operations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens are base64 encoded (placeholder implementation)
- In production, use proper JWT library with HMAC signing
- Tokens should expire after reasonable time (e.g., 24 hours)
- Implement token refresh mechanism

### Payment Integration
- Payment structure is complete but integration pending
- Platform takes 15% commission on all bookings
- Payouts to providers need automation
- Integrate Stripe or GoCardless for actual payments

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Security & Authentication (Critical)
1. Implement proper bcrypt password hashing
2. Add email verification with tokens
3. Set up OAuth (Google/Facebook)
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add CSRF protection

### Priority 2: Payment Integration (High)
1. Set up Stripe account
2. Integrate Stripe payment intents
3. Implement webhook handling
4. Set up automated payouts
5. Add invoice generation

### Priority 3: User Experience (High)
1. Build customer dashboard
2. Build provider dashboard
3. Implement notification polling system
4. Add booking calendar view
5. Create mobile-responsive improvements

### Priority 4: Compliance & Legal (Medium)

2. Add Terms of Service acceptance
3. Create Privacy Policy pages
4. Implement data export functionality
5. Add right-to-be-forgotten feature

### Priority 5: Testing & Quality (Medium)
1. Unit tests for API routes
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. E2E tests with Playwright
4. Load testing
5. Security penetration testing

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Password Hashing**: Currently using placeholder hashing. Must implement bcrypt before production.
2. **JWT Signing**: Using base64 encoding instead of proper HMAC signing.
3. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket support in Cloudflare Workers. Need polling-based solution.
4. **File Uploads**: Need to implement Cloudflare R2 for profile images and documents.
5. **Email Notifications**: Need to integrate email service (e.g., SendGrid).
